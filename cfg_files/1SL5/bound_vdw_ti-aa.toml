# ===========================================================
#      Protein-glycan docking with HADDOCK3
#
#  This workflow will dock a bound glycan to a bound
#  protein, with van der Waals energy weight increased 
#  from 0.01 to 1.0 in the rigid body haddock 
#  scoring function and ti-aa restraints (true interface 
#  on both protein and glycan).

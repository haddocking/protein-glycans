# ===========================================================
#      Protein-glycan docking with HADDOCK3
#
#  This workflow will dock a bound glycan to a bound
#  protein, with van der Waals energy weight increased
#  from 0.01 to 1.0 in the rigid body haddock
#  scoring function and tip-ap restraints 
#  (true-interface-protein, glycan fully passive).
